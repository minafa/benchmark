Notes:			

Summary: cg.C is Compute-bound in this configuration
Compute:				 100.0% |=========|
MPI:					   0.0% |
I/O:					   0.0% |
This application run was Compute-bound. A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is found in the CPU and accelerator sections below.
As very little time is spent in MPI calls, this code may also benefit from running at larger scales.

CPU:
A breakdown of the 100.0% total compute time:
Single-core code:			    0.0% |
OpenMP regions:				  100.0% |=========|
Scalar numeric ops:			   30.5% |==|
Vector numeric ops:			    0.0% |
Memory accesses:			   69.5% |======|
Waiting for accelerators:		    0.0% |
The per-core performance is memory-bound. Use a profiler to identify time-consuming loops and check their cache performance.
No time is spent in vectorized instructions. Check the compiler's vectorization advice to see why key loops could not be vectorized.

OpenMP:
A breakdown of the 100.0% time in OpenMP regions:
Computation:				   62.3% |=====|
Synchronization:			   37.7% |===|
Physical core utilization:		  100.0% |=========|
System load:				   77.1% |=======|
Significant time is spent synchronizing threads in parallel regions. Check the affected regions with a profiler.
This may be a sign of overly fine-grained parallelism (OpenMP regions in tight loops) or workload imbalance.

MPI:
A breakdown of the 0.0% MPI time:
Time in collective calls:		    0.0% |
Time in point-to-point calls:		    0.0% |
Estimated collective rate:		0.00e+00 bytes/s
Estimated point-to-point rate:		0.00e+00 bytes/s
No time is spent in MPI operations. There's nothing to optimize here!


I/O:
A breakdown of the 0.0% I/O time:
Time in reads:				    0.0% |
Time in writes:				    0.0% |
Estimated read rate:			0.00e+00 bytes/s
Estimated write rate:			0.00e+00 bytes/s
No time is spent in I/O operations. There's nothing to optimize here!


Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:		9.67e+08 bytes
Peak process memory usage:		9.85e+08 bytes
Peak node memory usage:			    4.0% |
The peak node memory usage is very low. Running with fewer MPI processes and more data on each process may be more efficient.


Accelerators:
Error reading metric: Unknown Error
